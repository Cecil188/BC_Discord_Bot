This is a Discord Bot for the Final Fantasy: Beyond Chaos randomizer!

## About the Bot

This is a basic look-up bot that is currently set to load in excel files and look up information when a user makes a request.
The bot's functionality is located within the Cogs folder. Each Cog would ideally have somewhat separate functionality, and it is designed so that it will load each cog separately.

The majority of the bot's functionality is heavily based on [GreenKnight's Desktop CecilBot](https://github.com/greenknight5/CecilBotDesktopApp). His excel files were also used to create the MySQL database that this currently runs on.

## Deployment

To deploy, note that you will need to have MySQL installed, and either your own data, or a copy of the database (please contact me to request a current copy). 

## Built With

* [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
